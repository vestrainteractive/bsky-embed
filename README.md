New in version 1.1:  Shortcode and dark mode support!
[bsky_embed username="vestrainteractive.com" limit="4" height="150" mode="dark"]

Version 1.1 and later does not need the truncate.js file.  We have left it here for legacy reasons.  In the final release zip, it will not be included.
You will likely need to style the output using CSS.
